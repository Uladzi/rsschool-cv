## Summary: 

Recently I've given up years of experience in different spheres to fulfill my dream.  
At present time I study Front-end development.  
After that I'm planning to get work experience (e.g. unpaid practice) and then to start my career as a Front-end developer.

I don't think that everybody is going to teach me when I come to the workplace as a Junior developer. 
I understand, that being a Junior means always learning new things from everywhere.

I'm responsible and decent.
Eager to improve my knowledge constantly, ready to learn and develop according to specifics of activity.
Always try to look for positive sides in negative situations.
